## Projects
**Waze Churn Analysis**
[Publication](https://nbviewer.org/github/WickyTheAnalyst/waze-churn-analysis/blob/main/waze-churn-analysis-stage5.ipynb)

Created a ML model to forecast user attrition within the Waze application. Our approach involves five key stages: data inspection and analysis, exploratory data analysis (EDA), hypothesis testing, regression modeling, and the development of a tailored ML model. Operating under Google's umbrella, Waze was provided with valuable insights and predictions that helped user churn effectively, ultimately enhancing the user experience of this GPS navigation service.

**Mercedes-Benz HR Analytics - Employee Retention and Attrition Prediction**
[Publication](https://nbviewer.org/github/WickyTheAnalyst/mercedes-benz-hr-analyticss/blob/main/mercedes-benz-hr-analytics.ipynb)

Led the analysis of HR data at Mercedes-Benz to identify factors influencing employee attrition and developed a predictive Machine Learning model for attrition forecasting. This project aimed to enhance employee satisfaction and reduce turnover by leveraging data-driven insights. Key tasks included data cleaning, regression modeling, and tree-based modeling (Decision Tree & Random Forest), resulting in actionable recommendations for HR strategies.

**Stack Overflow Case Study**
[Publication](https://nbviewer.org/github/WickyTheAnalyst/python-eda-stack-overflow-survey/blob/main/eda-stack-overflow-version2.ipynb)

Conducted an in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) using **python** on the Stack Overflow Annual Developer Survey 2020 dataset to uncover valuable insights. This project involved key activities such as dataset selection and retrieval, thorough data cleaning and preparation, exploratory analysis through data visualization, and the formulation and exploration of intriguing questions within the dataset. The results were summarized, and meaningful conclusions were drawn from the analysis, demonstrating proficiency in data analysis and visualization techniques.
